# Sketching-with-your-head-VR

This is an experimental Unity-based painting application developed for Meta Quest 2. It allows users to draw in a grid canvas using only their head movements and voice commandsâ€”no controllers required.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview

The application supports multiple drawing modes (free draw, lines, color picking), brush sizes, and mirror effects. It also includes a UI system for menus and color selection that appears in front of the user. Input is driven by:

- **Head movement**: Used to change modes, control UI interactions, and perform specific gestures in different modes.
- **Voice commands**: Used to trigger modes, select tools, and interact.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Head Gesture Recognition**
  - Tilting head **right** opens the menu.
  - Tilting head **left** cycles through drawing modes.
  - Tilting **up** = Redo, Tilting **down** = Undo.
  - Circular gesture detection (clockwise/anticlockwise) to navigate drawing history, pixel by pixel.

- **Game States**
  - `Draw` â€“ Enables painting actions
  - `UndoRedo` â€“ Interacts with gesture-based history
  - `ChooseColor` â€“ Opens color picker canvas
  - `Navigation` â€“ Moves the canvas through head tilt
  - `Menu` â€“ Opens the floating menu in front of the user
  
- **Voice Command Support**
  - `free` â€“ Free drawing mode
  - `line` â€“ Line drawing mode
  - `picker` â€“ Color picker tool
  - `size` â€“ Switch to brush size adjustment mode
  - `rewind` â€“ Enables rewind gesture mode
  - `forwards` / `backwards` â€“ Move forward/back
  - `click` â€“ Simulates click
  - `draw`, `menu`, `undo`, `navigation`, `color` â€“ Switches GameState
  - `stop` â€“ Resets to default mode


- **UI & Interaction**
  - Floating menus appear in front of the user
  - Visual feedback for drawing and selection
  - Voice-based command input system with sound feedback
  - Save painted texture as PNG
